      A <strong>car</strong>, or an <strong>automobile</strong>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle">motor vehicle</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel">wheels</a>. Most definitions
      of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people,
      have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than cargo.[1][2]
      There are around one billion cars in use worldwide.

      The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered
      road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz
      designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile
      in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday
      use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his
      Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the
      20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T,
      both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced[3][4]
      and mass-affordable[5][6][7] cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted
      in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[8] In Europe and
      other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until
      after World War II.[9] In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing
      rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised
      countries.[10][11]

      Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety
      of lamps. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been
      added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include
      rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car
      entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an
      internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels.
      Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became
      commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy
      than petrol-driven cars before 2025.[12][13] The transition from fossil
      fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate
      change mitigation scenarios,[14] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable
      solutions for climate change.[15]

      There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual
      include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed),
      repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees,
      taxes, and insurance.[16] The costs to society include maintaining roads,
      land-use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health,
      and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions
      are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[17] Personal
      benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and
      convenience.[18] Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job
      and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation
      provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities.
      People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching
      implications for the nature of societies.[19]

<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<hr />
<p>
  The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum
  "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled
  cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot".[20][21] It
  originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart,
  carriage, or wagon.[22] The word also occurrs in other Celtic languages.[23]
  <p>
    "Motor car", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British
  English.[2] "Autocar", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally
  meaning "self-propelled car", is now considered archaic.[24] "Horseless
  carriage" is attested from 1895.[25]
  </p>
  <p>
    "Automobile", a classical compound
  derived from Ancient Greek autós (αὐτός) "self" and Latin mobilis "movable",
  entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of
  Great Britain in 1897.<sup>[26]</sup> It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used
  chiefly in North America,<sup>[27]</sup> where the abbreviated form "auto" commonly
  appears as an adjective in compound formations like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_industry">auto industry</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_mechanic">
      auto
      mechanic
  </a>".<sup>[28][29]</sup>
